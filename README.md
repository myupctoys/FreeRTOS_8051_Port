# 8051 Port with FreeRTOS 2_4_1 with SDCC 2_5_0
FreeRTOS 2_4_1 with matched SDCC 2_5_0 compiler

Caveat, don't expect support from the SDCC or the FreeRTOS development teams given this is now 18 
years old. Only intended as a starting point for the 8051 port. As with others, all I wanted 
is a starting point. Hopefully this helps someone else out.

Went through the process of trying to port a newer version of the FreeRTOS Cygnal port to
a newer version of SDCC. Got a fair way through only to be met with a parser bug in SDCC that
apparently was introduced to SDCC a long time ago. Just dumb luck the Silabs/Cygnal port stumbles into it,
presumably not enough of an issue that it causes much of a problem elsewhere.

Only reason I figured this path out was becasue I played with 8051's FreeRTOS and SDCC in the very early 
2000's and know it worked at that point in time. Just a case of ploughing through the half a dozen versions 
I had floating around to find the latest combination that worked.

Have been able to confirm FreeRTOS V2.4.1 compiles with SDCC V2.5.0 May 8 2005 without error, 
zero modifications to the source and the Makefile as is.  I did add a clean to the Makefile 
to get rid of the clutter after a compile.

End up with an Intel hex file. "main.ihx" file placed in the root folder directory for reference. 
Original FreeRTOS project folder structure retained but removed the other ports in the project. They still
exist in the zip.

Just need the path added for your Make and SDCC binary. Update the Compile.bat for your local instance. 
For completeness, GNU Make version used was 64 bit 4.3 on W10 64 bit.

Made comment previously about Cygwin having an issue with cygwin1.dll for SDCC. I stand corrected after 
following through documenting assorted build problems for a separate project. There is no issue 
realted to SDCC and cygwin1.dll 64 bit. The actual issue was in relation to WinAVR and msys-1.0.dll,
totally unrelated to the 8051 port. Just wanted to correct the record. As such I have removed the 
Cygwin1.zip from the repo.

Donâ€™t know if the FreeRTOS binary works, just that it compiles. At least it builds confidence and should only be
treated as a starting point. 

#1 Clone or Zip this Repo locally to your PC.<BR>
#2 Unzip the SDCC zip to a likely place on your HDD (preferable without spaces in the directory names).<BR>
#3 Install GNU make (not included), I used GNU make 4.3 in Cygwin 64 bit on W10.<BR>
#4 Modify the Compile.bat file in the Cygnal demo directory to point to SDCC and your Make binary "bin" folders.<BR>
#5 Run the Compile.bat batch file.<BR>
Batch file will set the path, clean, then make.

Command line "make" from the Cygnal Folder. "make clean" cleans out the clutter.
Should see a screen as below.<BR><BR>
